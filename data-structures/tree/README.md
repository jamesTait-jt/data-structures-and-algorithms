# Tree
A tree is a data structure consisting of a root node and subtrees of children
represented as a set of linked nodes. Each child must only have one parent, and
there are no cycles. for an n-ary tree, each parent has a maximum of n children,
with the tree being complete if each parent has n children, or 0 children if it 
is a leaf.
