# Stack
A stack can be best explained with an analogy. Imagine you are stacking plates
on top of each other. You can put one plate on top of the stack (push) or you
can take one plate off the top of the stack (pop). We can only interact with the
top of the stack of plates. This stack works much the same way but we can only
interact with the tail of the list.

## Functions included

###### push(x)
The _push(x)_ operation adds an element _x_ to the top of the stack (appends to the
head of the list).

###### pop()
The _pop()_ operation removes the element at the top of the stack (head of the list).

###### multiPush(xs)
The _multiPush(xs)_ operation pushes multiple elements _xs_, stored in list form, on to the stack.

###### multiPop(n)
The _multiPop(n)_ operation removes pops n elements from the top of the stack.
