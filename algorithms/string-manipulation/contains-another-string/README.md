You need to write a function to search for the existence of a string (target) in another string (source). The function takes two strings as the input and returns the index where the second string is found. If the target string cannot be found, then return -1. If you are a Java developer, then you can related its behavior to indexOf() method from java.lang.String class. This question is also asked as Code and algorithm to check if a given short string is a substring of a main string. Can you get a linear solution (O(n)) if possible?
