This is one of the interesting String question, which also has lots of variants. You need to remove duplicate characters from a given string keeping only the first occurrences. For example, if the input is ‘bananas’ the output will be ‘bans’. Pay attention to what output could be, because if you look closely original order of characters are retained the in output. This is where many developer make the a mistake of shorting character array of String and removing duplicates, similar to how you remove duplicates from array. That destroys original order of characters and will not be correct solution in this case.
