I have seen this String interview question on many interviews. It has a easy recursive solution but thinks get really tricky when Interviewer ask you to solve this question without using recursion. You can use Stack though. Write a program to print all permutations of a String in Java, for example, the if input is "xyz" then it should print "xyz", "yzx", "zxy", "xzy", "yxz", "zyx".
