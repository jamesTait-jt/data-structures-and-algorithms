One of easiest String question you will ever see. You have to write a Java program which will take a String input and print out number of vowels and consonants on that String. For example the if input is "Java" then your program should print "2 vowels and 2 consonants". If you get this question on Interview, you should clarify that whether String can contain numbers, special characters or not e.g. anything other than vowels and consonants.
