One more difficult String algorithm based coding question for senior developers. You are given 3 strings: first,  second, and  third.  third String is said to be a shuffle of first and second if it can be formed by interleaving the characters of first and second String in a way that maintains the left to right ordering of the characters from each string. For example, given first = "abc" and second = "def",  third = "dabecf"  is a valid shuffle since it preserves the character ordering of the two strings. So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects whether third String is a valid shuffle of first and second String.
