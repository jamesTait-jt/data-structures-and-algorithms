One of my favorite coding question, when I interview Java developers. You need to write a Java method which will accept a String and a character to be removed and return a String, which doesn't has that character e.g remove(String word, char ch).  You need to provide both iterative and recursive solution of this method and also has to write JUnit tests to cover cases like null and empty String, input which only contains letter to be removed, String which doesn't contain given character etc.
