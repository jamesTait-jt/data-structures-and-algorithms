To start with, we have a simple String related coding question frequently asked in programming interviews. You need to write a program in C, C++, Java or Python to print duplicate characters from a given String, for example if String is "Java" then program should print "a". Bonus points if your program is robust and handle different kinds of input e.g. String without duplicate, null or empty String etc. Bonus points if you also write unit tests for normal and edge cases

You need to write a program to print all duplicate character and their count in Java. For example if given String is "Programming" then your program should print
g : 2
r : 2
m : 2
