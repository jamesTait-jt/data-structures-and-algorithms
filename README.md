### String Manipulation
* Determine whether a string is an anagram of another.
* Determine whether a string contains another string.
* Determine whether a string contains only digits (numbers).
* Count the occurences of each character in a string.
* Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
* Find the first non-repeated character in a string.
* Find the most often occuring character in a string.
* Find the longest palindrome in a string.
* Determine whether a string is a palindrome.
* Find all the permutaions of a string.
* Print the characters that are duplicated in the string
* Remove duplicates so that each character is unique.
* Remove all occurences of a given character.
* Replace all ocurences of a given character with another character.
* Reverse the string.
* Reverse every word in a sentence.
* Sort strings by length.
* Determine if a string can be formed by interleaving the characters of two
  other given strings.
* Convert string to it's integer representation.
